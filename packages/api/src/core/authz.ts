/**
 * Authorization policy (Phase 12 / ADR-010) — the role→capability matrix, in one auditable place.
 *
 * Every authed intent is classified here. The dispatch guard calls {@link authorize} after auth and
 * before the handler. Roles: `member` (contribute), `manager` (steer: OKRs/briefs/admin), `ceo`
 * (read-only org-wide). The rules:
 *   - WRITE intents are denied for `ceo` (the read-only role) — even though ceo outranks for reads.
 *   - MANAGER intents (steering) require manager or above.
 *   - everything else is readable/usable by any role (member+).
 *
 * Intents NOT listed are treated as member-level reads (the safe default for query/introspection).
 * agent.enroll is public (no principal) and never reaches this guard.
